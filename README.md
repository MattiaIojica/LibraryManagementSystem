8. **Loans Displaying:**
   - The system allows the display of a user's loans.
9. **Loans Reservations:**
   - The system allows the display of a user's reservations.
10. **Database Storage:**
    - The system uses a database to store information about users, books, fines, loans, and reservations.

## MVP Features:

### 1. User Management:

The system should allow administrators to manage user information, including registration, retrieval, update, and deletion of user profiles.

#### Key Functionalities:

- User registration with essential details (firstName, lastName, email).
- View and edit existing user profiles.
- Delete user accounts if needed.


### 2. Book Management:
Description:
The system should enable efficient handling of the library's book inventory, covering aspects like adding new books, updating book details, and removing books from circulation.

#### Key Functionalities:

- Add new books to the library inventory with details such as title, author, and ISBN.
- Update existing book information.


### 3. Loan Management:
Description:
The system should support the process of loaning books to users and managing the return of borrowed items, including tracking due dates and fines.

#### Key Functionalities:

- Loan books to users, associating them with due dates.
- Record book returns and calculate fines for overdue items.
- Display a user's active loans.


### 4. Reservation System:
Description:
The system should allow users to reserve books that are currently unavailable, providing a queue system for popular titles.

#### Key Functionalities:

- Users can place reservations for books that are currently on loan or unavailable.
- Display a user's reservations.


### 5. Fine Management:
Description:
The system should handle fines accrued by users for overdue book returns, allowing administrators to manage and users to view their fines.

#### Key Functionalities:

- Automatically calculate fines based on due dates for returned books.
- Display a user's current fines.
- Admins can view and manage fines, including marking them as paid.

## Controllers 

- UserController /users
- BookController /books
- LoanController /loans
- FineController /fines
- ReservationController /reservations
- AddressController /addresses

```Java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/books")
public class BookController {

    private final BookService bookService;

    @Autowired
    public BookController(BookService bookService) {
        this.bookService = bookService;
    }

    @PostMapping
    @Operation(summary = "Create a book",
            description = "Returns the new book")
    public ResponseEntity<BookDto> createBook(@RequestBody @Valid BookDto bookDto) {
        ...
    }

    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    @Operation(summary = "Update a book",
            description = "Update a book's information based on the provided book ID")
    public ResponseEntity<BookDto> updateBook(@PathVariable Long id,
                                              @RequestBody @Valid BookDto bookDto) {
        BookDto updatedBook = bookService.updateBook(id, bookDto);
        ...
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    @Operation(summary = "Delete a book",
            description = "Delete a book by id from the database")
    public ResponseEntity<Void> deleteBook(@PathVariable Long id) {
        ...
    }
  ...
}
```
  
## Services

- UserService 
- BookService 
- LoanService 
- FineService  
- ReservationService  
- AddressService  

```Java
@Service
public class BookService {

    private final BookRepository bookRepository;
    private final BookMapper bookMapper;

    @Autowired
    public BookService(BookRepository bookRepository,
                       BookMapper bookMapper) {
        this.bookRepository = bookRepository;
        this.bookMapper = bookMapper;
    }

    public BookDto createBook(BookDto bookDto) {
        ...
    }

    public BookDto updateBook(Long id,
                              BookDto bookDto) {
       ...
    }

    public boolean deleteBook(Long id) {
        ...
    }
  ...
}
```

## Repositories
- Each entity has an associated interface that extends *JpaRepository<Entity, Type_ID>* where the methods that were not in the basic interface were defined (those already existing: findById, findAllById, delete, save, ...)
```Java
@Repository
public interface UserRepository
        extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {

    List<User> findAllByAddress_Street(String street);

    @Query( nativeQuery = true, value = "select * from user where firstName = :name")
    User findUserByFirstNameWithNativeQuery(String name);

    Optional<User> findByEmail(String email);
}
```

## Model mapper 
- The classes of type *@Component* with the purpose of mapping request-type entities into entities used as a model in the database
```Java
@Component
public class UserMapper {

    private final AddressMapper addressMapper;

    public UserMapper(AddressMapper addressMapper) {
        this.addressMapper = addressMapper;
    }

    public List<UserDto> mapListToStudentDto(List<User> users){
        return users.stream().map(this::mapToUserDto).collect(Collectors.toList());
    }

    public User mapToUser(UserDto userDto) {
        ...
    }

    public UserDto mapToUserDto(User user) {
        ...
    }
}
```

## DTOs
- Each entity of type *EntityNameDto* contains all field validations according to type
```Java
public class UserDto {

    @Schema(accessMode = READ_ONLY)
    private Long id;

    @NotNull(message = "First name is mandatory.")
    @NotBlank(message = "First Name must have a value.")
    @Schema(name = "firstName", example = "John")
    private String firstName;

    @NotNull(message = "Last name is mandatory.")
    @NotBlank(message = "Last Name must have a value.")
    @Schema(name = "lastName", example = "Smith")
    private String lastName;

    @NotNull(message = "Email is mandatory.")
    @Email(message = "Email should be valid.")
    @Schema(name = "email", example = "email@example.com")
    private String email;

  ...
}
```
## ‚úÖ Testing

UNIT tests for REST endpoints and services with all tests passed.


```Java
  public class BookControllerUnitTest {

      private MockMvc mockMvc;
      @Mock
      private BookService service;
      @InjectMocks
      private BookController controller;
  
      ...
  
      @Test
      public void testGetAllBooks() throws Exception {
          List<BookDto> dtoList = getDummyDtos();
          Mockito.when(service.getAllBooks()).thenReturn(dtoList);
  
          mockMvc.perform(MockMvcRequestBuilders
                          .get("/books"))
                  .andExpect(status().isOk())
                  .andExpect(MockMvcResultMatchers.content().json(new ObjectMapper().writeValueAsString(dtoList)));
      }
  ...
}
```

```Java
  public class BookServiceUnitTest {

    @Mock
    private BookRepository repository;
    @InjectMocks
    private BookService service;

    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() {
        MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this);
    }

    @Test
    void testDeleteAddress_SuccessfulDeletion() {
        Long idToDelete = 1L;

        when(repository.existsById(idToDelete)).thenReturn(true);

        boolean result = service.deleteBook(idToDelete);

        assertTrue(result); // Deletion should be successful
        verify(repository, times(1)).deleteById(idToDelete);
    }
  ...
}
```


## üíª SWAGGER

```
http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html
```
![SWAGGER](https://github.com/MattiaIojica/LibraryManagementSystem/blob/main/Swagger.png?raw=true)

Contains information for each API

```Java
@GetMapping("/{id}")
    @Operation(summary = "Get a User by id", description = "Returns a user as per the id")
    @ApiResponses(value = {
            @ApiResponse(responseCode = "200", description = "Successfully retrieved"),
            @ApiResponse(responseCode = "404", description = "Not found - The User was not found")
    })
    public ResponseEntity<UserDto> getById(@PathVariable @Parameter(example = "1") Long id) {
        return ResponseEntity.ok().body(userService.getById(id));
    }
```
